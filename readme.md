# ShreeEyes

ShreeEyes is an innovative application designed to assist blind and visually impaired individuals navigate their environment with ease. It captures screenshots of the surroundings using a device's camera and sends them to an AI-powered analysis engine. The AI identifies objects in the image and provides feedback to the user through voice commands. The app uses **TensorFlow.js** for object recognition, **Brain.js** for training AI models, and is built using **Next.js** for the frontend.

ShreeEyes acts as both a companion and caretaker, helping blind users with navigation, daily life tasks, and awareness of the objects and people around them.

## Features

- **Object Recognition**: Uses AI to recognize objects in real-time through the deviceâ€™s camera and provides verbal feedback to the user.
- **Navigation Assistance**: Provides voice-guided navigation, helping users move through different environments safely.
- **Weather Updates**: Continuously updates the user with real-time weather information to stay informed of the environmental conditions.
- **Environmental Awareness**: Provides feedback on the user's current surroundings and any obstacles or important landmarks they might encounter.
- **Personal Companion**: Engages in interactive conversations to assist the user with daily tasks and act as a virtual caretaker.
- **Future Features**: Will integrate sensor data (like temperature, humidity, etc.) and other lifestyle tools to make daily living easier for blind users.
- **Multi-Platform Future Support**: Currently a browser-based application, but will expand to native mobile and desktop apps in the future, similar to screen readers like NVDA and TalkBack.
- **Technologies Used**:
  - **TensorFlow.js** for object recognition.
  - **Brain.js** for training AI models.
  - **Next.js** for the frontend.
